# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis
## Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for a fictional telecommunications (telco) company. The project aims to understand the factors affecting customer retention and churn rate. By analyzing patterns in customer data, we identify which customers are most likely to leave, the reasons behind churn, and the impact of churn on the company and the industry as a whole. This analysis was performed using Power BI.
## Objectives
1. Analyze the rate at which customers leave the company.
2. Investigate the impact of customer churn in the telcom industry as a whole.
3. Identify which customers are leaving.
4. Identify the reasons why customers are churning.
5. Identify which customers have the highest churn rate.
## Dataset Overview
The dataset in this analysis contains various customer attributes, They include:
1. Customer ID: Unique indentifier for each customer
2. Demographics: gender, age, relationship status, dependents, etc.
3. Contract Type: Monthly, annually, etc.
4. Service Usage: internet services, phone services, etc.
5. Customer Satisfaction: Customer ratings and feedback.
6. Churn Status: Whether the customer has churned or not and reasons for churning.
7. Payment Method: Payment type (e.g., credit card, bank transfer).
## Analysis
### Churn Rate Analysis
To analyze the churn rate, we calculate the percentage of customers who leave the company within a specific time period. This helps us understand overall customer retention.
### Insights:
- The overall churn rate in the company is found to be 26.5%.
## Customer Segmentation for Churn 
We analyze the customer dataset to segment it into different categories, such as:
- Gender
- Age(under the age of 65 or not)
- Contract(anually, monthly, etc).
- Service usage(internet services, phone services).
- Demographics(Has a partner, has a dependant or not).
- Satisfactory levels.
### Results
- Female customers are more likely to churn than Male customers.
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate at 55% compared to longer-term contracts (annual contracts have 20% churn rate).
### Reasons for Churn
Using customer feedback and support tickets, we perform text analysis to identify the most common reasons customers cite for leaving:
- Network Reliability
- Product dissatisfaction
- High prices
- Service dissatisfaction
- Lack of self-service on Website
- Moved
- Limited rage of services etc.
A sentiment analysis of  churn reasons reveals that over 200 of the customers who churned cited "Network Reliability" and "Product dissatisfaction" as key reasons.
## Insights and Results
- Month-to-Month contracts and electronic check payment methods are major churn drivers.
- Fiber Optic users have higher churn rate.
- Churn is prevalent among customers with no dependents or are senior citizens.
- Network reliability and product dissatisfaction are the highest reasons for churn.
## Conclusion
The analysis indicates that customer churn in the telco industry is a significant challenge, driven by factors such as customer services, pricing, and network issues. By targeting at-risk customers, particularly those with month-to-month contracts, senior citizens and those without dependants and partners, the company can reduce churn and improve retention. Additionally, using predictive models allows the company to proactively address customer concerns and retain high-value customers.
To address churn, the company should:
- Focus on improving customer service and addressing billing issues.
- Introduce more competitive pricing models, particularly for younger customers.
- Offer loyalty programs or longer contract plans to reduce churn rates.
